One example of code smell is the multiple usage of same piece of code in different area. Refactoring can eliminate this smell by setting up functions that would be used to call them once and for all. Another example of code smell is excessive long line of code. Refactoring can remove this problem by separating one line of code into different lines with comments.</div>
