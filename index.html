One example of code smell is the multiple usage of same piece of code in different area. Refactoring can eliminate this smell by setting up functions that would be used to call them once and for all. Another example of code smell is excessive long line of code. Refactoring can remove this problem by separating one line of code into different lines with comments.</div>

If you hit the Canvas and don't hit the ImageSprite, you lose 1 point. How would you code this?</div>

The second one is a little more complicated. I suppose don't know which event handler would trigger first, so I will have two separate events of canvas click and sprite click. When one of them is clicked, the corresponding variable would be set to one and call the procedure that checks if both variable is on. When both variable is setted to true then it would awards a point, else it would lose point.</div>

We also added the “upcase” and “trim” blocks to make sure that the text wouldn't have to be case sensitive and would disregard any peculiar spacings at the end of an answer, Which would then move on to the other part of the algorithm. The next part of the code is the point system and the parts of the app that tell the user that they are correct or not. If the user inputs text into the textbox that compares to the text in the answer list then it would update the global score by incrementing the variable by 1, which would also then change the score label to match the global score variable. Then the high score updater is called, the correct label is set to “correct!” and the “rightPlayer” would be called and that  would play the ding sound to signify that the user is correct. If the user’s text does not compare then the algorithm would change the correct label text to “Wrong!

It picks one random element inside the list, called pivot, then move all numbers smaller than the pivot to the left of the pivot, and move all numbers bigger than the pivot to the right of the pivot. Then, all numbers on the left and right side of the pivot are sorted again using the picking the pivot method. After several iterations of this process, the array would be sorted after all. Picking the median number or a random number as the pivot of the array proved to be an efficient way to increase the efficiency of the algorithm.</div>
